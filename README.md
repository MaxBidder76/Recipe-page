## My process

I started by styling the body color. After that I used the div element to create a block, then i gave the block it background color. After that I imported the image and used both HTML and CSS elements to style the rest of the body. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned that using image width and height function will make the whole design not to be mobile responsive.


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
 <div class="content">
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
ol > li::marker {
    font-weight: bold;
    color: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
}
```
### Continued development
I will like to continue developing myself on how to differntiate mobile and desktop responsiveness of my designs.
